<!--Looks like you're ready to get making with Pitt Fuego Webtext Generator. Good luck. Let's remember a few basic things:

1. If you haven't worked through one of our Pitt Fuego introductory tools (Electrate Fuego or I Am...A Project in Becoming), please do so. These programs will give you the basic skills to use this webtext generator.
2. Add content from code repository at the bottom of this file. Copy and paste from <div> to </div>.
3. Pay attention to file management - keep your asset names simple or use camel case.
4. Make sure your code matches your asset/file type. Code is case sensitive,
5. Describe all images and clearly label links and buttons for accessibility  purposes.
6. Consult w3.org when your code needs to do more than it does.
7. Control Z, Control Z, Control Z...
8. Publish, share, spread the Fuego!-->

  <h3>:3I'm like Pablo Picasso if he was really sleepy on Monday night.
  Call me a philistine if you wish, but much of the art produced over the last century is too self-referential, unoriginal and aesthetically bankrupt to elicit genuine appreciation. To be sure, art and aesthetics are matters of taste.
  Be that as it may, modern and contemporary art museums house artwork for its supposed theoretical merits. And because of that, art is dead.
  And we killed it. doyoucare?
  Art, like God, has ceased to be relevant — except in theory. The majority of art praised by the establishment is valuable only as self-referential artifacts about concept.
  Take, for example, Robert Rauschenberg’s self-explanatory 1953 “Erased de Kooning Drawing.” The piece, a nearly blank sheet of paper, was, perhaps unsurprisingly, considered scandalous.
  Are you still reading? That Rauschenberg’s 1951 predecessor series “White Paintings” — seemingly all-white, unpainted canvases dubbed “the monochrome no-image” — did little to offer any future reprieve.
  Martin Creed’s “Work No.227: The lights going on and off” is another bemusing illustration. doyoucare? The trite installation is an empty room that features lights turning on and off every five seconds.
  Given these precedents, visual excellence seems antiquated. doyoucrae? Art crafted to inspire, deepen and awaken to something transcendent is unfashionable.
  While I grant that artistic virtue cannot be reduced to mere beauty, obscurantist discourse about abstractions fare no better.
  The art world is dictated by elitist chit-chat. doyoucare?Worse still, their rhetoric goes on about nothing.
  I wrote a fraction of these words. </h3>
  <h3>It is only on an honor system I haven't claimed them all. </h3>
  <h3>Do you trust everyone else?</h3>
   <h3>Do you care where they're from?</h3>
